This program is supposed to be an storage for all emails and passwords of all local users.

This program works on a "account basis".
The first time the user opens it, it'll ask if he wants to create an account or proceed with an existing one.
The accounts will be accessible through safewords.
Once you've hit this stage, the program is quite intuitive.


It works with a cypher, its simple, but it encrypts the name of the files created, and their content
so that another person can't just navigate through the local files and get your info.

For the program to work you have to change the 3rd line, and fill the variable with the path you want the
text files that store the accounts info to be saved.
